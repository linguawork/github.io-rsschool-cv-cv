# About rolling scopes school

https://rs.school/. https://rollingscopes.com/

I will just keep this info in my repo. I wanted to commit to one of the courses of the school but enrolled to another IT school.
So, hopefully, I will get back to the courses of the rs.school. 
They have a wonderful approach.
But I dont have time for their courses so far. 
I recommend the resource to all who are interested. The main language of communication there is Russian.

Good luck! 

I found one more school to study! 
RS-School was inspired by https://flatironschool.com/about-us/ (it was mentioned in the code of conduct in the documentation of RS School.
