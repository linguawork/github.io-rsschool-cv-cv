I will just keep this info in my repo. I wanted to commit to one of the courses of the school but enrolled to another IT school.
So, hopefully, I will get back to the courses of the rs.school. 
They have a wonderful approach.
But I dont have time for their courses so far. 
I recommend the resource to all who are interested. The main language of communication there is Russian.

Good luck!
